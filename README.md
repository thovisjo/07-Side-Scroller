# 07-Side-Scroller
This is a side scroller! I really enjoyed this assignment. Everything made sense, and came together easily. I like the blocks well-enough to keep them and instead focus on the enemies killing and implementing a goal - a golden block - that progresses the player onto the next level. I tried to implement a jumping noise, but for some reason it wouldn't load, even after converting it to an mp3 file. I did implement a cool tune though!

In the future, I might come back to this and:
* Add more sound effects and music tracks that fit
* More closely integrate the music and the game, ie make colors change on a certain beat
* Add more levels
* Make enemies move!!!!!
* Add sprites
* Figure out how to display lives ( I know vaguely how to do it, but theres a lot of cross-class stuff right now)
